## Views

- Views are components dedicated for `react-routing`
- Mostly don't have styling
- Define position of containers and components on the page
- Tests are placed in separate directory in order to allow async loading
  When you will use `import()` with dynamic path webpack will convert everything in the folder to chunks.
  Tests (as well as styles and other support files) shouldn't be converted.
